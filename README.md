This project implements a real-time face recognition system with a unique twistâ€”it only recognizes real, live individuals. By leveraging blink detection, the app distinguishes between actual human faces and static images or photos, adding an extra layer of security and authenticity.

Overview
This application uses advanced computer vision techniques to:

Detect and recognize faces in real time.
Verify liveness through blink detection, ensuring the subject is a real person and not a picture or spoof.
Provide a robust solution for applications requiring secure identity verification.
Whether you're building a security system, an interactive app, or facial attendance system.
